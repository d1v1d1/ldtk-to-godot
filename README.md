# LED to GODOT 3.2

- LDTK : https://deepnight.net/tools/led-2d-level-editor/
- Godot : https://godotengine.org/

Just a starting point...

- [X] Parse the json file
- [X] Convert all the led's tilesets in one godot's tileset.res file
- [X] Create one tilemap per layers
- [X] Create a scene
- [ ] Fix bugs
- [ ] Clean the mess
- [ ] Make UI
- [ ] Make a standalone tool or a plugin ?


If a tileset in LDtk is named "Collision", the tileset will be a collision tileset (so we can "paint" collision on the level).
